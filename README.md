# AI Advertising & Fundraising Assistant for Small Businesses

Small businesses often face growth challenges not due to a lack of ideas, but because most available guidance assumes ideal conditions such as abundant time, budget, and manpower. In practice, vendors must make decisions under tight constraints, where unrealistic recommendations can lead to wasted effort and missed opportunities.

This project presents a constraint-aware AI decision support system designed to assist small business owners in planning advertising, promotional, and expansion activities in a realistic and resource-sensitive manner. Instead of focusing on full automation or direct execution of marketing actions, the system emphasizes guided decision-making by analyzing key business constraints such as business type, available budget, time availability, and growth objectives.

Based on these inputs, the system provides structured recommendations that clearly distinguish between:

1. activities that can be automated,
2. activities that can be supported by AI, and
3. activities that require direct human involvement.

In addition to growth planning, the system includes a fundraising and collaboration component that enables businesses to express resource needs—such as capital, skills, or partnerships—and explore potential support opportunities without handling real financial transactions.

The overall goal of the project is to demonstrate how AI can be used responsibly to support small businesses through explainable, constraint-aware guidance, rather than generic optimization or over-automation.

## Design Philosophy

Decision support over decision replacement

Explicit modeling of real-world constraints

Transparency in recommendations

Human-in-the-loop approach

Practical guidance rather than theoretical optimization

## Scope and Limitations

This system does not automate advertising campaigns

It does not integrate directly with ad platforms or payment gateways

It does not guarantee business growth or revenue outcomes

Recommendations are advisory and intended to support, not replace, human judgment

## Intended Use

Concept demonstration for intelligent decision support systems

Exploration of responsible AI in small business contexts

Academic review and evaluation

Foundation for future extensions and research
